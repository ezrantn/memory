# memory

This project is an experimental simulation of memory management in Go, inspired by the behavior of `alloc`, `malloc`, and `free` functions in C. It provides a simple framework for allocating, initializing, and freeing memory in a controlled environment.

The project is designed to explore how memory management could work in a language like Go, which has its own garbage collection and memory management system.
